## How to use

To use this project especifically, you need to provide a `.env` file in the main directory (i.e. "./"). In this file there should be a link to a firebase realtime database that has to be set to a key of "VITE_REACT_FIREBASE_URL":

```dotenv

VITE_REACT_FIREBASE_URL=https://your-project.firebaseio.com/cart.json
```
